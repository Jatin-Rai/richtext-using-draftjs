- Typing `#` as the first string in a line & pressing space makes anything you type afterwards on the same line be in a “Heading” format. On pressing space the aforementioned `#` should disappear.
- Similarly, typing `*` as the first string in a line and pressing space correspond to “bold” format
- `**` and space = red line
- `***` and space = underline
